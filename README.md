NetworkTest
===========

Network Test sample app using Xamarin. Currently implements only an iOS app and it is used to demonstrate how to use platform classes from mono base class library to call native netowrk API calls.

The problem it solves that it returns the subnet mask as well. Currently, this is not implemented in Mono for Linux and Mac OS. 

Here is my original problem description from stackoverlfow.com:
